# Ember Data Model Maker
Ember Data Model Maker (EDMM) is a tiny Ember.js app (built with [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli)). Its purpose is to give a little clarity about what code is needed to get your app up and running with Ember Data.

## Demo
[http://andycrum.github.io/ember-data-model-maker/](http://andycrum.github.io/ember-data-model-maker/)

## Requirements
EDMM requires [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) to run. Once you've installed ember-cli, just navigate to the EDMM directory and run `ember serve` to get it running locally.
