# Ember Data Model Maker
Ember Data Model Maker (EDMM) is a tiny Ember.js app (built with [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli)). Its purpose is to give a little clarity about what code is needed to get your app up and running with Ember Data. It was originally written as a 'companion app' to [Getting Started with Ember Data](http://andycrum.com/2014/06/02/getting-started-with-ember-data/).

## Demo

## Requirements
EDMM requires [ember-cli](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli) to run. Once you've installed ember-cli, just navigate to the EDMM directory, run `npm install`, `bower install`, then `ember serve` to get it running locally.
